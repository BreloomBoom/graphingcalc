# graphingcalc

just some graphing calculators made in python

DesmosFake.py can graph functions

DesmosFake++.py can graph relations and is more accurate than DesmosFake.py

DesmosCalc.py can graph functions as well as its derivative and integral but only if both exist and have the same accuracy as the first
